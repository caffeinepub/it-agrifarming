  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-19, REQ-20, REQ-21) appear to be implemented. The backend adds a PlantEmotion variant type and deterministic emotion logic based on blob size. The frontend PlantResults component shows emotion cards with emojis, labels, and messages above the need-detection cards. The useQueries hook file summary indicates it returns a full Plant result including the emotion field.",
